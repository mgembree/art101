				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> I had multiple problems when trying to make the special button. First, the button wouldn't actually change anything,
					I found out that my css file wasn't linked, thanks to the console in my browser. Then I couldn't make the button toggle the class
					back and forth, then it would only change the text to the different color. I ended up looking up how to change attributes more accurately,
					and found the attr() method, which can be used to change a class to an id attribute. it takes the current class, the type of attribute, and the name of 
					the attribute as its parameters.  
				</p>

			<div id="reflection">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I learned a lot about how attributes are managed in css and how to manipulate them using jQuery.	</p>

			</div>
			<div id="results">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p> I used the instruction example to create the button and attach it to the challenge ID, but 
					I ended up looking up online how to make the button do what it is intended to do.
