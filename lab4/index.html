				<h1> Pseudocode - UNO </h1>
				<pre><p5>
				//Initialize 108 card deck stack
						//For every 25 cards switch color (Red Green Yellow Blue)
						// 1: ‘0’ card , 2 of each: ‘1-9’ cards, 2:skips, 2: draw+2, 2:reverses
					//The remaining 8 cards are 4: +4’s & 4: wilds
						//0&1-9 cards g(0-9)=green card number 
						//y!2 = yellow + 2 card 
					//Shuffle deck (Randomize elements)
					//Designate a discard pile(stack) which holds nothing now.
					//create player hands(dynamic arrays)
					//define function "dealcard" for needed mechanic
						//popdeckstack, store in player hand
		
				//Start game
						//popdeckstack to get top card then move it to the discard stack
						//call dealcard 7 times - starting hand is 7 cards for each player/bot
						

				//Player turn/validation
						// display the card to the players
						// display the player’s hand 
						//game must validate a card can be played and will return the card to the players turn if invalid.
							//+4 and wild cards can be placed at any time
							//after being played input is required to tell the next color for discard pile. 
								// ex: g5 is a green 5 players must play a wild or g() card.
						// if a player cannot play a card, they will have to draw a card to end their turn.
						// once validated, turn is handed to next player/bot

				//Game End Scenarios
						//Once a player has two cards in hand 
						//the player must type UNO into the console before playing a card or else they must draw another card.
						//if the deck empties, take all but the top card from the discard stack, randomize and add to deck stack.
						//Having an empty hand results in a victory
